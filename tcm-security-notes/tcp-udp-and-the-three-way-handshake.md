# TCP, UDP, and the Three way Handshake

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** Connection oriented protocol **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** Connection-less protocol

TCP is better used for reliability UDP is better used for stuff like DNS, Streaming, Vo-IP

**Scanning is important** Most commonly scanned protocol **(TCP)**

**Three-way Handshake** SYN (hello) SYN ACK (response, hey SYN) ACK (good to go, handshake established)

To connect to port 443 on a website SYN packet is sent to the website (Hey i want to connect to you on port 443) If port 443 is open and available for connection Web server responds with SYN ACK When you want to establish connection, ACK is sent&#x20;
