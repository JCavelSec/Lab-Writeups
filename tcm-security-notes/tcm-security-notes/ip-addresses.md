# IP Addresses

**Layer 3** IP Addresses&#x20;

**Layer 2** MAC Addresses, identified as ether when using ifconfig. These can be thought of as physical addresses.&#x20;

**Switches communicate over this physical address.**&#x20;

This is how switches determine what device is what.

Anything that uses a network interface will have a MAC Address.&#x20;
