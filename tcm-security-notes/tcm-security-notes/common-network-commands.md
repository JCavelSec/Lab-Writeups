**ifconfig iwconfig** (wireless)

ifconfig is becoming deprecated the new and improved version is **ip** ip n (arp table) ip r (routing table)

**arp** associate IP addresses with MAC addresses  After I pinged the kali box using my macos machine, my macos machine's IP is now listed when we used arp -a

**netstat** shows you active connections running on your machine

Comes in handy to see if a machine is talking to somebody else

**route** this command prints out your routing table
