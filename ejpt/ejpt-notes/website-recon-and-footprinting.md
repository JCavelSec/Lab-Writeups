**WAF with wafw00f**\
_WAF stands for Web Application Firewall_

**wafw00f**\
WafW00f is an open source tool used for detecting and fingerprinting web application firewalls (WAFs).

**How does WafW00f work?**\
It works by analyzing HTTP responses from a web application and searching for patterns and anomalies that are indicative of the presence of a WAF.

WafW00f is often used to test the effectiveness of WAFs and identify potential vulnerabilities in web applications.

**Subdomain Enumeration With Sublist3r**

**What is Sublist3r?**\
Sublist3r is a python-based open source tool used for subdomain enumeration. It works by querying multiple search engines, including Google, Yahoo, and Bing, as well as other sources such as certificate transparency logs, to generate a list of subdomains associated with a target domain

Sublist3r is commonly used to identify potential attack vectors, such as unsecured subdomains, misconfigured DNS records, and other security vulnerabilities. This tool should be used ethically and responsibly, as subdomain enumeration can be used for malicious purposes.

**DNS Zone Transfers**\
DNS or Domain Name System, is used to translate human-readable domain names into IP Addresses that are used by computers to identify and communicate with each other over the internet.

**How does DNS work?**\
DNS works by maintaing a distributed database of domai names and their corresponding IP Addresses. When a user types in a domain name in their web browser, the browser sends a DNS query to a DNS server, which then looks up the corresponding IP Address and returns it to the browser.

How do DNS Zone Transfers work?\
DNS Zone Transfers are a mechanism used to replicate DNS databases between primary and secondary DNS servers. When a primary DNS server is updated with new DNS resource records, it notifies secondary DNS servers that are configured to replicate the zone. The secondary DNS servers then request a copy of the updated DNS database from the primary DNS server using a zone transfer.

DNS Records

**DNS Interrogation**\
DNS Interrogation is the process of enumerating DNS Records for a specific domain. It can be used to diagnose and troubleshoot DNS-related issues, such as identifying the cause of DNS resolution failures or misconfigured DNS records.

It can also be used to perform reconnaissance and obtain information about a target network or domain. Therefore, it is important to ensure that proper security measures are in place to protect against unauthorized DNS interrogation or exploitation.

Using the `-sn` argument,

`nmap -sn 10.0.0.0/24`\
Using nmap with the -sn switch tells Nmap to perform a "ping scan" of the IP addresses in the range `10.0.0.0` to `10.0.0.255` and report which hosts are up and running, **without performing a port scan**.

**Netdiscover**\
An open-source network address discovery tool that is used to discover hosts and devices on a local area network (LAN). It actively sends ARP requests and listens to ARP replies to identify devices and their associated MAC addresses, IP addresses, and vendor information

Netdiscover can be useful for network administrators who want to identify all the devices on a network or identify unauthorized devices. It can also be used to scan for vulnerable devices on a network.

**How do Netdiscover and Nmap differ?**

**Nmap:**

* A network exploration tool that scans a network for hosts, services, and vulnerabilities.
* Conducts a comprehensive port scan and identifies the services running on those ports.
* Can perform a variety of advanced techniques such as OS detection, version detection, and service enumeration.

**Netdiscover:**

* A network exploration tool that scans a network for live hosts and provides basic information such as MAC address and manufacturer.
* Uses ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to discover live hosts on a network.
* Does not provide detailed information about the services running on hosts.

Nmap Lab\
\
Here we ran `ip a` to find the IP Address of the Kali Machine we are using to perform Nmap scans.

<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LQuuVfC.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We then used the ping command to determine if our target host is up or not.\


<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3U175sQ.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We then ran our first nmap scan against our target `10.4.16.154` which determined that the target was blocking ping probes, which indicated we needed to use `-Pn` , this switch tells Nmap to do no ping, which skips the host discovery stage altogether.

![](https://i.imgur.com/s81RE5L.png)

In the screenshot above, we can see that now nmap was able to discover the target host's open ports to identify the running services and applications.

Then we performed the same scan but added the `-sV` switch (Version detection), which tells Nmap to send a series of probes to determine the versions of the services and applications running.
