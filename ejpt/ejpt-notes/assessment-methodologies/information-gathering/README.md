# Information Gathering

Information gathering is the first step of any penetration test and is arguably the most important as all other phases rely on the information obtained about the target during the information gathering phase. This course will introduce you to information gathering and will cover the process of performing both passive and active information gathering by leveraging various tools and techniques in order to obtain as much information as possible from a target.
