# Website Foot-printing With Netcraft

Netcraft can be used to enumerate information **passively** from a website.\
It also correlates information such as:

* WHOIS
* SSL or TLS certs
* Web Technologies being used
* Name servers

This saves you time from doing manual work, as Netcraft provides a lot of information that would otherwise take more time to gather if done manually.

Using results from our internet data mining, find out the technologies and infrastructure of any site.\
Explore hostnames visited by users of the Netcraft extensions. Search by domain or keyword.
